abstract  ="A task-oriented virtual assistant (VA) refers to an ar-tificial intelligence-driven system that can assist users to perform daily activities. The utilisation of deep learning algorithms has enabled VAs to attain noteworthy advancements in high-resource languages, such as English. However, languages with limited resources, such as Bengali, have not encountered significant advancements in this domain. In this paper, we propose a multilingual task oriented voice-to-voice conversational agent, which is capable of proficiently managing diverse tasks such as weather forecast, date & time query, hospital and blood bank search etc in both Bengali and English language. Our developed system can understand voice command using Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) and Natural Language Understanding Unit (NL U). Then the system generates an appropriate reply by gathering information from the internet via APIs, data retrieval techniques and by employing dialogue management. Finally, Natural Language Generator (NLG) and Text to Speech (TTS) techniques are used to construct and deliver proper response. We integrated all the units using RASA framework and python script. Our developed ASR system has an average word error rate of 13% and NLU system has an intent and entity extraction accuracy of 93 % and 96.2 % respectively. The overall action prediction accuracy of our developed system is 99.4%.",
