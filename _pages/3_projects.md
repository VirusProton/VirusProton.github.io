For now, the projects are not described. Only the cards are shown. Overtime I will gradually, populate the contents of each of the projects. 

*These projects include research works that have not been published (yet). Published works are listed under [__Research__](/research/)*

<!-- pages/projects.md -->
<div class="projects">
{%- if site.enable_project_categories and page.display_categories %}

  {%- for category in page.display_categories %}
  
  {% if category=='work' -%}

  The following projects are the ones I worked on as a part of my job at <b>ACI Limited</b>. The list is not exhaustive, as I have omitted many of the aspects of individual projects, due to confidentiality. However, I have tried to be as descriptive as possible. Just like the other projects, I will keep updating these over time.
