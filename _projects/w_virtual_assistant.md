The primary objective of this project was to create an intuitive and user-friendly system capable of delivering accurate and contextually relevant information to both employees and root-level users. This virtual assistant seamlessly integrates several advanced technologies to ensure it operates efficiently without the need for constant human intervention.

`LLM`, `RAG`, `ASR`, `TTS`

> Components of the overall system and technologies which for each components

* Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR):
    * `Technology Used`: Transformer-based model Whisper.
    * `Functionality`: Converts spoken language into text with high accuracy, enabling the assistant to understand and process user queries in real-time.

* Response Generation and Conversation Control:
    * `Technology Used`: State-of-the-art Large Language Model (LLM), Vector Database, RAG
    * `Functionality`: Acts as the core processing unit, interpreting the transcribed text and generating appropriate responses based on the input query.
    * `Enhancement`: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is employed to prvent hallucination and ensure that the responses are not only coherent but also contextually accurate by leveraging a domain-specific knowledge base. This integration significantly enhances the system's ability to provide precise business-related information.

* Text-to-Speech (TTS) Technology:
    * `Technologies Used`: VITS TTS and Style TTS.
    * `Function`: Converts the generated text responses back into speech, making the interaction more natural and accessible, especially for users who prefer auditory information.

* Multilingual Capability
    * The virtual assistant is designed to be multilingual, with the ability to operate proficiently in both Bengali and English. This feature is particularly beneficial for root-level users who may face challenges with new technology and language barriers. By supporting these two languages, the assistant ensures broader accessibility and usability, fostering inclusivity within the organization.
