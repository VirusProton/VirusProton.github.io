abstract  ="Plasmonic lasers offer great potential for cutting-edge{,} disruptive applications. However{,} they suffer from a high loss in metals{,} lack of spatial coherence in the near field{,} and divergent far-field emission. The challenges are even more significant for a plasmonic laser emitting more than one wavelength mode. The design complexity required for creating multiple modes often limits avenues for minimizing losses and converging far-field emission patterns. This work exploits plasmonic resonances at the junction of a merged lattice metal nanohole array (NHA) and a one-dimensional photonic crystal to achieve dual-mode lasing. The merged lattice NHA is designed by concentrically combining two simple NHAs with different periodicities to create pseudo randomness{,} leading to enhanced localization and confinement of light in multiple wavelength modes. The proposed structure notably produces intense dual-mode lasing at an ultra-low threshold compared to recent state-of-the-art plasmonic laser demonstrations. The wavelengths of the lasing modes and the separation between them can be tuned over a broad range by changing the structural parameters. The proposed laser also creates a highly directional far-field pattern with a divergence angle of only <0.35Â°.",

abstract = {Miniature lasers emitting dual-wavelength modes have diverse applications alongside the more explored single-mode counterparts. However, having dual-wavelength modes originating from a plasmonic-photonic hybrid laser is still a relatively new area for research. Compared to the amount of literature devoted to the physics of such hybrid cavities, only a few have analyzed their role in lasing applications. Notably, the role of hybrid cavities in dual-wavelength lasing is still unexplored. In this work, the properties of one-dimensional distributed Bragg reflectors and thin metal nanohole arrays come together to create a hybrid dual-mode plasmonic laser. The similar energy distribution characteristics of photonic and plasmonic lasers make hybrid structures a viable choice for efficient dual-mode lasing. In this work, the lasing cavity simultaneously excites photonic and Tamm plasmonic modes to generate dual-mode lasing. Consequently, the proposed laser shows high emission output with narrow linewidth and a clear and tunable mode separation.},
