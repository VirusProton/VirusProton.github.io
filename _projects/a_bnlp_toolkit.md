**BanglaNLPToolkit** is a package for several classic NLP text preprocessing and augmentations for Bangla NLP tasks.

**Project Link** : [BanglaNLPToolkit](https://github.com/sabbirhossainujjal/banglanlptoolkit)

Key features:
- Bangla Text Normalization.
    - Bangla text unicode normalization for text preprocessing using bnunicodenormalizer and csebuetnlp/normalizer.
    - Removal of punctuations or replacement of punctuations with desired sign as user desires.
- Bangla Punctuation
    - Add punctuations to Bangla texts with no punctuations: Uses deep learning based Named Entity Recognition models for accurate punctuation addition.
- Bangla Text Augmentation
    - Text augmentation techniques for generating similar but different texts for augmenting Bangla dataset.
    - Uses paraphrasing, cross translation and masked word prediction algorithms for augmented text generation.
- Simple Bangla Tokenizer
    - Robust simple word level and sententence level tokenizer for Bangla texts.
