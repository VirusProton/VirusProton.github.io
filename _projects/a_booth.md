<!-- booth multiplier that we have implemented is functionally correct as we can
see from the timing diagram. Also the circuit area has been minimized, as we tried to
make it as compact as possible. We used transmission gates for XOR gate, to minimize
delay . Also, the circuit only has 2 Layers of wires. These two layers also ensured that
there was minimal propagation delay and less errors. -->
