This project implements an intelligent vehicle monitoring system for business factories using CCTV footage. It leverages YOLO-V5 for vehicle detection and number plate extraction, integrating with a SQL database for automated rent vehicle billing and security logging.


Key feature of the project:
- Automatically detect incomming and outgoing vechicle in business factory from CCTV footage
- Effectively extract number plate information of incoming and outgoing vehicle
- Integrate with `SQL` database for automatically bill generation for rent vehicles
- Database logging system for ensuring security of the factory and outlets.

Key Technologies used in SpeechHub:
- Yolo-V5 model for vehicle detection and logging
- Automatic number plate extraction system using yolo-v5
- Integration of `FastAPI` based devOps system and `SQL` based database system for logging and billing.

Language/Framework: Python 3.9, PyTorch
