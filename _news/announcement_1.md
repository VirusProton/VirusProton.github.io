My team `ACI_ServerDown` has become the champions of the biggest data analysis event in Bangladesh <a href="https://www.robi.com.bd/en/datathon">Robi Datathon 3.0</a> organized by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/robi-axiata-limited">Robi Axiata Limited</a>, outshining 1,000 teams formed by 3,500 talented individuals.

This amazing achievement came after an intense and exciting two-part competition. After successfully navigating the initial selection process, we competed in an exhilarating 36-hour indoor challenge arranged for the top participants, going head-to-head with the best minds in the field.

Our victory is a reflection of the unwavering dedication and hard work of my incredible teammates: `Hasan Zohirul Islam Himel`, `Soham Irtiza Swapnil`, `Tahsen Islam Sajon`. I am incredibly fortunate to work with these outstanding colleagues.
