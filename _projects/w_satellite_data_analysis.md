This project leverages Sentinel-1 satellite imagery to accurately map croplands and concrete built areas in Bangladesh at the Upazilla level, providing a comprehensive understanding of land use patterns. By integrating advanced image processing and machine learning techniques, the project aims to enhance market size estimation and supply chain analysis. This will enable the identification of distribution gaps, logistical challenges, and potential sales opportunities in both agricultural and urban sectors, supporting strategic decision-making and improving overall market efficiency.
